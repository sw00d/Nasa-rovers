This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

It utilizes the NASA api to list the rover missions with corresponding photos.

### Beware: The `DEMO_KEY` API key often gets rate limited (I'm assuming lots of people using it). Get your own key from here if that's the case: https://api.nasa.gov/
